4. Inheritance 1 - Illustration 

 

The task is to calculate the area of the shape using a menu driven application. 

Write a Java program to Implement this task. 

 

Create a class called Shape. 

Include the following protected data members / attributes: 

shapeName – of type String 

Include the following methods : 

Create a constructor that initializes the shapeName 

calculateArea –  The return type of this method is Double. This method returns 0. 

 

  

Create a class called Square that extends Shape 

Include the following private data members / attributes: 

side – of type Integer. 

Include the following methods : 

Create a constructor that initializes the side. (1-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Square". 

calculateArea – calculates and returns the area of the square. The return type of this method is Double. 

 

Create a class called Rectangle that extends Shape 

Include the following private data members / attributes: 

length – of type Integer. 

breadth – of type Integer. 

Include the following methods : 

Create a constructor that initializes the length and breadth. (2-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Rectangle". 

calculateArea - calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. The return type of this method is Double. 

 

Create a class called Circle that extends Shape 

Include the following private data members / attributes: 

radius – of type Integer. 

Include the following methods : 

Create a constructor that initializes the radius. (1-argument constructor). Initialize the shapeName as "Circle". 

calculateArea – calculates and returns the area of the circle. The return type of this method is Double. 

 

Include appropriate getters and setters. 

 

Input and Output Format: 

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications. 

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output. 

 

Format the output with two decimal points
