5. Inheritance – Vehicle 

 

[Strictly adhere to the Object Oriented Specifications mentioned in the problem. Use the same Class names, attribute names and method names specified here. Use appropriate naming conventions for getters and setters. Create all classes in separate files] 

The task is to get the details of the vehicle and display the details using a menu driven application. 

Write a Java program to Implement this task. 

 

Create a class Vehicle 

Include the following protected data members / attributes: 

make – of type String 

vehicleNumber – of type String 

fuelType – of type String 

 

fuelCapacity - of type Integer 

cc – of type Integer 

 

Include the following public methods 

 

Create a constructor that initializes all the data members --- public Vehicle(String make,String vehicleNumber,String fuelType,Integer fuelCapacity,Integer cc) 

 

displayMake – Display the make of the vehicle 

 

"displayBasicInfo" – display basic information of the vehicle. 

"displayDetailInfo" – An empty method. 

 

 

 

Create a class TwoWheeler that extends Vehicle 

 

Include the following private attributes / data members: 

 

kickStartAvailable – of type Boolean. 

 

Include the following public methods 

 

Include appropriate constructors. 

 

"displayDetailInfo" – displays the availability of kick start. 

 

 

 

Create a class FourWheeler that extends Vehicle 

Include the following private attributes / data members: 

audioSystem – of type String. 

numberOfDoors – of type Integer. 

Include the following public methods 

Include appropriate constructors. 

"displayDetailInfo" - displays the audio system and number of doors. 

 

Include getter setters for all the classes. 

Create a main class to test the classes defined above.
